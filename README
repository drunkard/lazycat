= Description: =
This program spawns a pseudo-shell and gives the user interactive control.
The entire ssh/telnet session is logged to a file, others won't be logged.

= Required Python Modules =
This program is using python2, not compatible with python3 yet.

Needed python mods beside builtins:
pexpect

= Deployment: =
1. Add to /etc/shells, eg: echo /home/lazycat.py >> /etc/shells

2. Add a user whose shell is lazycat.py, eg: useradd -m -s /home/lazycat.py testuser
and, set a password for this user.

3. Start your ssh server.

4. Take a try, eg: ssh testuser@localhost, now you got into jail ;)
