===========
DESCRIPTION
===========
This project includes multiple sub-projects that ease management of ISP
network for network administrators. For now, they are independent partly, I
will join them together day by day. my python skill is poor, but improving ...

The most important sub-projects are:

 lazycat
 	pseudo shell with accounting function, it will be uniq and
  	easy entry to this whole project

 devconf
 	automatically backup network device config files, and commit
	them into git repository if differs
	Will be removed after merged into dm (device management)

 devlog
	receive and filter log from network devices, and archive;
	Filter messages by regex, then email to groups of admins.

And, this project is pure python 3 wrote, does not intend to support python 2.
