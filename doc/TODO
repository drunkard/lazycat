'device-management' - network device config management. sub enviroment, does these things:
	manages config policies to automatically retrieve config from network devices
	save it locally
	save config on remote device

	commands:
	host vendor 'vendor' name 'name' ip 'ip'
	remove host name 'name'
	remove host ip 'ip'
	# Check tasklets
	check hostname all	# 检查设备命名是否规范
	check hostname 'name'
	check hostname vendor 'vendor'
	check temperature 'name'
	check config syslog
	check config onu-bandwidth
	commit-config running 'name'
	commit-config saved 'name'
	detect-difference 'name'
	restore SHA-ID to 'name'	# 把配置恢复到设备, 通过ftp ?
	mailto 'email' SHA-ID	# named after @gwbnsh.net.cn | @shpbs.com
	show commit-status [failures|succeeded]
	show commit-status vendor 'vendor-name' [failures|succeeded]

	start server type [upload|download]

	stop server
	show server information


BUG:
'log view'
	does not have a good pager
	control code (from ssh, htop/atop) is kind hard to strip for me, by now.


'dns'	DNS problem diag, at least include these commands:

	list		List our DNS, name and IP
  	list-views	List views on our DNS, and query-source used to test for each view
  	resolve		Resolve the gave name from our DNS
	resolve from 'view-name' xx.com
	public-resolve	Resolve the gave name from famous public DNS
	reverse-resolve	Resolve IP address to domain name, so called ARPA
	trace		Manually trace resolve progress step by step


Multi-level or tree struct privilege control, which limits user capibility.

Store password or other critical data into encrypted loop back file, both usable for global or single user? This must be implemented before store password on server.


'user'	# manages users, this should be manage users across multiple hosts.

	add
	del
	disable
	disable at 'some time'
	enable


'session'	# this feature need mature pexpect code:
	With acl to control privilege, the lazycat will enter password for user automatically using pexpect.

A lot network device's config have same section on one function's config, like logging on H3C switches, almost all devices shares the same configs.
	logging config on devices
	ONU auto register
	privilege config on devices

Network trouble auto diag. Need to receive and parse logs from these devices. and then respond. Warn on administrator more precisely.

*nix server health check, do dns/squid first.

Add more interface, like web/GUI client, only CLI via ssh available now :(

'sessions list' shows current active telnet/ssh sessions, and someone can make request to observe others' session, when the session owner accepted, the requester can now do readonly observing, or even take charge the session, but it should be exclusive. It's too danger to operating the same vehicle in same time!
session>
	list	# replace 'show user', and TAGed each session with a short random key
	list telnet
	list ssh
	list idle
	kick TAG		# kick some user
	pause TAG		# pause session, by admin
	observe TAG		# observe in a window, there's cmdline below
	wait-for TAG		# wait for a exclusive session, take it when other quit
	share-from		# take charge of one session
	share-to
	say-to TAG		# say something to that session, receive from a TUI text block
	connect HostName	# auto login to host, password-less
	exit

Anyway, it faces to general network administrator, and gonna be simplify their work a lot. At least I hope so ;)
