# TODO list

BUG:
Save/read history file.
auto completion eats prompt, dam
'log view' does not have a good pager, the control code (from ssh, htop/atop) is kind hard to strip for me, by now.

Features to impletion:
DNS problem diag, at least include these commands:
  dns list		List our DNS, name and IP
  	list-views	List views on our DNS, and query-source used to test for each view
  	resolve		Resolve the gave name from our DNS
	public-resolve	Resolve the gave name from famous public DNS
	reverse-resolve	Resolve IP address to domain name, so called ARPA

Multi-level or tree struct privilege control, which limits user capibility.
Store password or other critical data into encrypted loop back file, both usable for global or single user? This must be implemented before store password on server.

Following features need mature pexpect code:
If got enough privilege, the lazycat will enter password for user automatically using pexpect.
A lot network device's config have same section on one function's config, like logging on H3C switches, almost all devices shares the same configs.
	logging config on devices
	ONU auto register
	privilege config on devices
Network trouble auto diag. Need to receive and parse logs from these devices. and then respond. Warn on administrator more precisely.
Auto backup device config, add them into git repository, showing the difference via web/client.
*nix server health check, do dns/squid first.
Add more interface, like web/GUI client, only CLI via ssh available now :(

Anyway, it faces to general network administrator, and gonna be simplify their work a lot. At least I hope so ;)
